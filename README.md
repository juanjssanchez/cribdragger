# Cribdragger

A moderately advanced cribdragging program. It compares 2 messages that were XORed with a key in order to attempt to recover the plaintexts. It also searches for partial word matches from a list of common english words in the dictionary text file, which can be replaced by your own common word dictionary.

## Cribword

The first step is to try a cribword. You will most likely see random letters and symbols at first. However, if the guess is partially correct, you may start to see partial plaintext as the output.

## Partial Dictionary Matches

Some partial plaintext outputs will match with a word from the dictionary. In this case, you have the option to use that word in your next guess.
